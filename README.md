# React-Native-Bootup
To help get going in React Native

So create-react-native-app wants you to use an older version of either node or npm.  You can simply download the npm 4 version  with this command

npm install -g npm@4

now you can run the create-react-native-app to build out a new project
this will globally install the older version of NPM so when you are done with the APP do not forget to run 

npm install npm@latest -g

to test which version you are currently running just use the commmand

npm -v 

This should get you up and going.  Please post any issues or updates to this by sending me an issue on GitHub and I'll correct/add to this repo and try and keep it up to date!
